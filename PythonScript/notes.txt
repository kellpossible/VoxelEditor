For the list of objects to intersect with the voxel array here are a few ideas on how
to filter the results:

use this solution by scorpion81
"<scorpion81> well maybe you can replace "context.scene", "objects" by a custom collection property you can fill with your "
https://github.com/scorpion81/Blender-Destructability-Editor/blob/master/object_destruction/destruction_proc.py#L2637

grounds = props.CollectionProperty(type = types.PropertyGroup, name = "grounds")

add a callback to this collectionproperty so that each time it is accessed, we run the filter check
and rebuild the collection and populate it with valid objects for intersection.



Bug report

self.bases = self.context.selected_bases.copy()

then go and delete an object

for b in self.bases:
  #check that the object still exists
  if(b in self.context.selectable_bases):
  	b.select = True

if I remove the check that b is still in the current selectable bases,
then this segfaults


Bug report/Feature Request

it's not possible to add a modifier to an object other than the bpy.context.object
and there seems like there is no way to change this to be bpy.context.active_object
the selected and active object.
