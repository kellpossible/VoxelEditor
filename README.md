Using
---------

To test out this project, I suggest creating a blend file in the PythonScript directory, and opening
up RunScript.py in the text editor. Then just hit the run button. This will add a new menu in the object
section of the properties editor, which will only appear when you have an empty selected.

Future Work
---------

* Split edges dialog, which can control the modifier on all of the intersected meshes in the voxel array
